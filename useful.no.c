/***********
Indirectly quoting macro arguments

The "#" directive can also be used indirectly, in order to quote the "value"
of a macro instead of the name of that macro. For example, with the macro:
*
***/

#define FOO bar
#define QUOTEME_(x) #x
#define QUOTEME(x) QUOTEME_(x)

// the code

printf("FOO=%s\n", QUOTEME(FOO));

// will expand to

printf("FOO=%s\n", "bar");

/*** One common use for this technique is to convert the __LINE__ macro to a string. Eg:

QUOTEME(__LINE__);

is converted to:

"34"

if __LINE__ happens to have the value 34 when QUOTEME() is called.
On the other hand QUOTEME_(__LINE__) will expand to "__LINE__"


The "#" directive is also used to solve the following preprocessor brainteaser
(involving characters, as opposed to strings): Define a macro, CHAR(), which
takes a single input character X in the source program text and converts it
into the C-language character value of X; that is, such that
***/

printf("%c\n", CHAR(a))
printf("%c\n", CHAR(b))

/**
yields

a
b


Solution:

*/

/***
The COMMENT macro is useful in creating flexible debug diagnostics that
can be removed by the preprocessor. As an example, I will define a macro
named DEBUG_ONLY. Preceding any line of code with the DEBUG_ONLY macro will
cause that line of code to be compiled only for debug builds.
For release builds, the DEBUG_ONLY macro will be interpreted by the preprocessor
as a single-line comment. The greatest advantage of this approach is that
any valid single-line expression can be used to convey debug information,
which makes this method more flexible than other parameterized macro approaches.
Also, this method is completely portable. The macros are defined as follows.
(Assume that in a debug build _DEBUG is defined for both the preprocessor
and the compiler, or substitute the symbol used by your compiler.)

#ifdef MY_COOL_FEATURE
... included if "my cool feature" is used ...
#endif


#ifndef MY_COOL_FEATURE
... excluded if "my cool feature" is used ...
#endif
An application that uses #ifdefs normally doesn't have to have any special handling of configuration variables.
#ifs
When you are using #ifs the preprocessor symbols that are used are normally always defined. The symbols that correponds to the symbols used by #ifdef are either true or false, which could be represented by the integers 1 and 0, respectively.
#if MY_COOL_FEATURE
... included if "my cool feature" is used ...

#if !MY_COOL_FEATURE
